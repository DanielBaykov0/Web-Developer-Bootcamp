    The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose
    from the red junglefowl, originally from Southeast Asia. They have also
    partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey
    junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock
    are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel.

      A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called
      a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

    Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their
    meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for
    cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated
    for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.
